## Why having a Strategy in the first place?

In software development in order to meet the requirements or even go beyond the expactations, one's ought to have a strategy. A strategy that helps to set decisions to help you come up with a plan of dos, don'ts and hows regarding the aimed application design, development and deployment, and move consistently through each step of a development project.

In this summary, I will explain step by step to achieve maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense, taking into account the specifics of enterprise and product software development.

. Study and Planning 
  
  As soon as the client or stakeholder has requested a project, the first thing to do is planning. The planning phase ensures you’re starting off on the right foot. One needs to make sure to include all of the departments that are going to be impacted by the given project, including project managers, developers, and key stakeholders,....



. Technical requirements

  Once you have done with the planning phase the next thing to do is understand the technical requirements of the given project. Moving forward you need to ask yourself the following questions:

    . What problems is this going to solve?
    . Who are the stakeholders and why?
    . What kind of data is needed?
    . Will you need to intergate other 3rd party APIs?
    . How are you going to handle security?

.Design and Prototyping 

  Going forward with the technical requiremets in place, it is time to design the blueprint of how the software will be looking like and how it will function. 

  This phase usually consists of creating wireframes to showcase how interactions will work in the software using tools like Figma, Adobe XD or Canva to test with end users. 

. Development/Implementation

    Done with the prototyping now, with the proposed funtionality and design of the software, it is time to start building and put into implementation what we've been planning. 


. Testing 

  As the team is developing the software, you’ll most likely be simultaneously testing, tracking, and fixing bugs. Once this phase done the product is ready to go, you’ll need to get your hands dirty and  do another round of more in-depth testing. This could mean releasing the product to a small group of  testers or using UX tools to track and monitor how users interact with it.


. Deployment
   
   With the heavy stuff out of the way, it's time to deploy the software so that everyone can have access to it, in other words pushing out code into production. 



. Maintenance and Update

  Once the software is out it's not over. The ending of one phase is just a beginning of the another, and that goes for post lunch as well.

  Requirements of the clients needs are always changing and as people begin to use the software there will be most likely bugs, request for new features, ask for nore or completely different functionality.
